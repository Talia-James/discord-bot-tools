# discord-bot-tools
Various tool for a Discord chatbot, able to be copy and pasted unless otherwise mentioned.
All tools except for the main.py file can be added and removed as desired; only the main script is needed to initialize the bot and keep it running.

By default the bot will use '!' as the character to initiate commands. This can be changed in the main.py file where noted, but the command should be kept to one character; otherwise text-based functions that use string slicing will be offset incorrectly. This could be adjusted manually of course but is beyond the scope of this project.
